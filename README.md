# Slot Machine Game ðŸŽ°

A JavaScript-based slot machine simulation that lets players deposit money, place bets, and spin the reels for a chance to win based on symbol combinations.

## Features

- **Deposit System**: Players can enter an initial deposit amount to start the game.
- **Line Betting**: Choose to bet on 1, 2, or 3 lines to increase your chances of winning.
- **Reels and Symbols**: The game features dynamic reels with symbols A, B, C, and D, each having a different payout multiplier.
- **Winnings Calculation**: Winnings are calculated based on matching symbols and their corresponding values. Players win by aligning symbols on the lines they've bet on.
- **Play Again Option**: After each spin, the player can choose to continue playing as long as they have sufficient balance.

## How it Works

1. **Deposit Money**: Enter the amount you wish to deposit as your starting balance.
2. **Select Lines**: Choose the number of lines to bet on (1-3).
3. **Place a Bet**: Enter the bet amount per line. The total bet will be calculated based on the number of lines.
4. **Spin**: The reels will spin and display random symbols.
5. **Win or Lose**: The game checks for matching symbols on the bet lines and calculates winnings based on the bet amount and the symbol's value.
6. **Repeat**: You can play as long as you have balance, or exit the game when you wish.

## Symbol Values

- **A**: Multiplier of 5x
- **B**: Multiplier of 4x
- **C**: Multiplier of 3x
- **D**: Multiplier of 2x
